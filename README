  This is the first release of the Game in very earlyer development 
  state. Only the main functionalities and a simple visualisation 
  had implemented. There are a lot of issues has to be implemented
  in the future (see todo) to get the first official release. 
  Since I'm very beginner in openGL, every help would be welcome.
