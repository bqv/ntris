2008 january 13. | Simzer

Two new function has been added to the game. First of all there is auto player function, so if your situation is desperate, you can ask for help. Second of all, the game now counts score. I also made a little video presentation of the game. Enjoy it, or at least the music.


4D-TRIS 0.1.1 - Initial release
2008 january 6. | Simzer

This is the first (initial) release of 4D-TRIS, an open source logic game. This software is an alteration of the well-known tetris game. The gamefield is extended to a 4D field, which have to filled by the gamer with 4D hyper cube. It is easier than it sounds (see description in 'Help' page). The software has been made in C with openGL and GLUT, it is platform independent, the source is under GPL, available in the download section also.

This release published at a very early stage of the development. Only the mayor features are implemented with simple, basic visualisation. But the sotware is fully operatable. So if you like Tetris, or BlockOut even more, try it and please feel free to contact me.

Beta testers and openGL developers (since I'm beginner) are very welcome.
